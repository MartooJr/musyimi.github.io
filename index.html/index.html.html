    <p>
        Nakuru Kenya National Park was first declared a conservation area for the birds that were Lake Nakuru including
        the flamingos in 1957 and the conserved area only included Lake Nakuru and small parts of the surrounding areas.
        This was done to preserve the lake, reduce on the pollution of the lake and conserve the bird life that was
        blooming on Lake Nakuru.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1961 the already declared conversed area which is the current southern section of Nakuru National Park was
        declared a bird sanctuary and different protocols introduced to ensure bird protection in the that area were put
        in place.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 1968 Lake Nakuru National Park, was gazetted as one of Kenya’s National parks. This was after the park area
        was expanded to include the northern savannah lands of the park which saw the park’s total area grow to 188km2.
        Also several mammals were introduced to the park, to diversify the park from just a bird sanctuary to also an
        animal park.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lake Nakuru National Park was given the honours of being home to the very rare and endangered Rothschild
        giraffes in 1977 when the giraffes were brought to Lake Nakuru National park from western Kenya for conservation
        and protection. This initiative by the Kenyan government was a boast to its efforts of preserving wildlife in
        the East African country.

    <p>
        After the rothschild’s giraffes, rhinos were also introduced in Lake Nakuru Kenya Park in the 1980s; in a Kenyan
        government initiative to conserve the endangered rhinos that were drastically declining in number. This was the
        first of its kind in Kenya and in 1984, Lake Nakuru park was designated the first government protected rhino
        sanctuary in Kenya.
    </p>

    <p>
        To further protect the rhinos from poachers, the Kenyan government erected a 188km2 electric fence around Nakuru
        National Park in 1986. This fence was and still serves the purpose of keeping poachers away from the Lake Nakuru
        park as well as keeping the rhinos within the bounds of the park. After the successful construction of the
        188km2 electric fence and the Kenyan government officially declared Lake Nakuru Park a rhino sanctuary in 1987.
    </p>
